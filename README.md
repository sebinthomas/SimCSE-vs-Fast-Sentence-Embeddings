# Sim-CSE vs Fast Sentence Embeddings 

Running the STS benchmark for the [SimCSE](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SimCSE) model and the [Fast Sentence Embeddings ](https://github.com/oborchers/Fast_Sentence_Embeddings)model.

The benchmark is the [STS benchmark](http://ixa2.si.ehu.eus/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) and scripts from the benchmark to run Pearson correlation, have been used here.

Files have been downloaded from the STS benchmark site. We only take the sts-dev file to run the benchmark.

**SimCSE** scores around **65.98** while **FSE** scores around **45.5** for *glove-wiki-gigaword-50* and around **63.135** for *paranmt-300* and using the  *Averages* model.
